    <p1 class="left"> <h2>About Eclipse</h2> Eclipse was started in January 2021 as a starter for it's me to start programming, but as time went by, Eclipse started to grow, eventaully ending up in 7 servers and watching 230 people. The current prefix for Eclipse is "e!", but that is subject to change as development progresses.<br></br> <h2>The Future of Eclipse</h2> Eclipse has gained and lost multiple features, and will be shutting down temporarily due to the discord.py project being haulted. In the mean time, I will (hopefully) be learning discord.js, a far superior library to discord.py. Maybe i'll end up using pycord (an alternative to discord.py), but the future for Eclipse seems muddy at the moment.<br></br> <h2>Why Eclipse?</h2>You should invite Eclipse to your server becasue it has a whole bunch of fun features that your members might enjoy, and some moderation features that your Mods and Admins might enjoy. Those features range from doing simple math to banning someone. A full list is linked above in the button that says "Features".</p1>
